# FileRead

## Program to count each letter, digit, special character, and number of lines in a text file.

# Main
1. Open a text file "input.txt" and read all characters into an array in memory. Limit the
length of the array to 10000 characters. The maximum number of characters to be read should
be 10000 characters. The actual number of characters depends on the file length. MARS
provides the system calls for opening and reading a text file.

2. If the file does not exist then the
program should display an error message and terminate.

3. Traverse the array character by character. Count all uppercase letters, lowercase letters,
digits, and all other special characters. In addition, count the lines (A line ends with a '\nâ€™
character). A single-letter line should not be counted.

4. Display the total count of letters (uppercase/lowercase), digits, special characters, and
lines.
